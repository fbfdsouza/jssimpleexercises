Started the 28 hours udemy javascript course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course.

Here I will be pushing the exercicies from the course I've completed.

The goal is to register my evolution with the language and have the exercicies stored on github as a source to help myself to remember what I've already studied.

The exercicies may also be a good start point for people who want to review many aspects of the javascript language.
